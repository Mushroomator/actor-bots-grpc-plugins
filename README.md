# Actor Bots - Hashicorp Go plugin system
Implementation of bots as actors using [Proto.Actor](https://proto.actor) as the underlying actor framework and [Hashicorp's Go Plugin System](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin) to load behaviors/ functionality i. e. plugins for a bot at runtime. 

> Alternative implementaion of the same idea using GoLang's native plugin system introduced in [Go 1.8](https://go.dev/doc/go1.8) is available [here](https://github.com/Mushroomator/actor-bots-golang-plugins).
